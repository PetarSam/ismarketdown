# ismarketdown

Building the simplest webapp with Flask, inspired by isitchristmas.com it returns simple mmessage 
stating if NASDAQ is down or up from yesterday

Flask was used for the routing and Jira for templating, while beautiful soup 4 was used for getting
the data from 'https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/ndaq'

To run it just clone it, set the virtual environment and flask run.
The deployed app will be available on heroku soon
